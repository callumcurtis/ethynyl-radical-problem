Exercise in the use of POSIX semaphores.

## Acknowledgement
This exercise is from an assignment created by David Clark and Mike Zastre from
the University of Victoria for the course CSC 360: Operating Systems. The
project structure and framework have been modified slightly to allow my solution
to be featured separately.
